# Reading List

This is an application I made to test out using React Context API in combination
with hooks. When combined together this gave me tons of cool functionality like
global state, reducers, and more without needing to use Redux!

Reading List is also an app that I used to code along with students
at BrightCode to demonstrate the power of these new React features.
